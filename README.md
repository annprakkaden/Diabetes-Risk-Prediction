"Predicting Diabetes Risk: A Machine Learning Approach Using the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset"

Dataset: CDC Diabetes Health Indicators

Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the risk of developing diabetes based on various health factors provided in the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset.

Project Background and Context

Background:
Diabetes has become a significant global health concern, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prevention are crucial in managing this chronic disease. The CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset provides valuable insights into various health factors and their relationship with diabetes.

Problem:
The primary challenge is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the risk of developing diabetes based on the available health indicators. This model can aid healthcare professionals in early identification and intervention, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.

Goal of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as having a high or low risk of developing diabetes based on various health indicators provided in the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset.

Diabetes Status:
A categorical variable indicating whether an individual is healthy, pre-diabetic, or diabetic

Categorical Features: Sex, race, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, health insurance coverage, and diabetes status.

Numerical Features: Age, BMI, number of days of poor mental health, number of days of poor physical health.

Overall Structure:
The dataset is typically structured in a tabular format, with each row representing an individual and each column representing a specific feature or attribute.
By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to diabetes risk and develop effective strategies for prevention and management.
